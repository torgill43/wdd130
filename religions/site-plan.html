      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever driven down the road and wondered why there are so many different church buildings everywhere? This is a question that I have frequently asked myself. If God really is the God of everyone, why is there so much division in the world? There are so many good people out there and I wanted to know what beliefs inspired people to live the way they live. My website will consist of my experiences while studying various religions throughout the world. An increased understanding of the beliefs of major religions will not only lead to a more appreciative look at life and the world around us, but also to greater cultural awareness.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone and everyone. I believe it is our responsibility as citizens of the world to have an understanding and at least a marginal interest in the lives of the people around us. We don't have to believe or live as our neighbor believes or lives, but we should at least have a basic understanding of why said neighbor does what he or she does.</p>  <!-- change this -->
