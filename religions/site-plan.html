      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever driven down the road and wondered why there are so many different church buildings everywhere? This is a question that I have frequently asked myself. If God really is the God of everyone, why is there so much division in the world? There are so many good people out there and I wanted to know what beliefs inspired people to live the way they live. My website will consist of my experiences while studying various religions throughout the world. An increased understanding of the beliefs of major religions will not only lead to a more appreciative look at life and the world around us, but also to greater cultural awareness.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone and everyone. I believe it is our responsibility as citizens of the world to have an understanding and at least a marginal interest in the lives of the people around us. We don't have to believe or live as our neighbor believes or lives, but we should at least have a basic understanding of why said neighbor does what he or she does.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Welcome! My goal is to share my experiences as I study the religions of the world. I think everyone should know a little about what everyone believes. This helps foster deeper relationships and greater understand as to why people do the things they do.

      <h3>Islam</h3>
      <p>
        Brief History: Islam began around 600 BC when Muhammad was visited by angel Gabriel. This was when he wsa commissioned to "Proclaim... in the name of the Lord". A commonly-known practice that Muslims pray 5 times a day. This comes from Muhammad's "Night Journey" to Mt. Hira (near Mecca). In the presence of Allah, Muhammad was initially commanded to have Muslims pray 50 times a day. After pleading, this was graciously reduced to 5 times per day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love that the Muslim beliefs are so clear and are practiced similarly throughout the world. One thing that stood out to me the most is their passion for scripture. It is seen all over their communities - in government offices, markets, taxis, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beauty: Women in their culture/religion enjoy many more rights and freedoms than do women in many other religions.<br>
        Divinity (inspired of God): They go to great lengths to make sure people are taken care of. Acts of charity need not be complicated or extravagant.<br>
        Holy Envy: I admire their devotion to memorizing scripture, fasting, and prayer.

      </ul>
      <h3>Shinto</h3>
      <p>
        Brief History: There is no known founder and it is not clear when the Shinto religion actually began, although it is estimated that it began between 400 BC and 600 AD. Shinto practitioners put less emphasis on religious beliefs and more on the ritualistic experience of connecting with their Divine. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Experience: I admire that they put such an emphasis on purity. If they are not pure, they cannot engage in worship. While I believe that anyone can commune with their Divine, how much greater could our experience be if we tried to maintain a purer state of mind? Their idea of Kami is also fascinating. “A kami is understood to mean anything that can inspire in human beings a feeling of awe, reverence, or mystery.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Beauty: They take great care of the nature around them (think of Japanese Gardens in the US).<br>
        Divinity (inspired of God): There is Kami (divinity) in everything. Having this perspective could lead us to thinking and acting kinder to all creatures, including other people, plants, and animals. <br>
        Holy Envy: I admire their commitment to rituals. My life would be much more meaningful if I was more mindful about the things I do each day.
