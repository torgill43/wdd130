                    Brief History: <br>Islam began around 600 BC when Muhammad was visited by angel Gabriel. This was when he was commissioned to "Proclaim... in the name of the Lord". A commonly-known practice that Muslims pray 5 times a day. This comes from Muhammad's "Night Journey" to Mt. Hira (near Mecca). In the presence of Allah, Muhammad was initially commanded to have Muslims pray 50 times a day. After pleading, this was graciously reduced to 5 times per day.

                    My Experience: <br>I love that the Muslim beliefs are so clear and are practiced similarly throughout the world. One thing that stood out to me the most is their passion for scripture. It is seen all over their communities - in government offices, markets, taxis, and more.
