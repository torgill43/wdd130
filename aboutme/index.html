            My name is Tim Orgill and I am from Idaho Falls. You would think I am used to the cold, but I'm not. My wife and I have been married for just over a year now and we are super happy. Some day we hope to live somewhere a little warmer but we will just have to see where the next few years take us. We love to watch shows and movies, ride 4-wheelers, go on walks, and do all sorts of fun stuff together.

            I am a Software Engineering major. I'm still not quite sure what I want to do for a job after graduation but I am really intrigued with creating stuff (programs, software, web development, etc.). Outside of classes, I teach yoga on campus (Tuesday nights at 9 pm) and am in the process of becoming a certified instructor. I love yoga because I think the body is fascinating and I believe there is a lot to be gained by becoming more mindful and bringing together mind, body, and spirit.
